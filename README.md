# Eid
In the spirit of Eid I present this and for my curiosity in wrangling and mining data in R.
A brief history : Id-Ul-Fitr commonly known as Eid marks the end of fasting (Ramadhan) and is the first day of the Islamic month Shawwal.
The following link contains information about Eid, its occurence of per Day, Month, year. For today, I intend to only mine the table and
explore.

# Objectives
1. Mine data - table - from a URL using the package rvest (this was my first time and its really simple)
2. Explore basic data cleaning using dplyr (this is included in tidyverse library)
3. Explore the occurence of Eid i.e per month, per day
4. Perform visualization using ggplot :-).

This is a learning curve and feel free to drop in your comments and/or suggestions. I will show you a bit of my thought process when
analysing and wrangling data.
